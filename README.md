# from-scratch

`from-scratch` is a project to build a game fully from scratch, using only X11 and OpenGL.

No libraries other than x11 and OpenGL are allowed.

Currently, it supports loading and (sort of) rendering any `.obj` file, when exported triangulated and with vertices in
order.

## How to Build

Linux + X11 only.

1. `make` to compile
2. `./bin/from-scratch` to run
